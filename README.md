Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Endigneering is a form of engineering where systematic applications of engineering principles, methods and tools are employed in the development and maintenance of software systems. Software Engineering is important to the technology industry because it powers various aspects of modern life especially in healthcare like seeing early signs of a sickness and providing an accurate diagnosis.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of programme languagues like C.
2. Software Engineering establishment as a discipline in the 1960's.
3. The growth and rise of agile Methodologies in the 2000's 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
2. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
3. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases and it is appropriate to use when a project is a large-scale infrastructure project, and in regulated industries like finance and Healthcare. It should be used in structured and predicatble projects like the construction of a bridge. In contrast, agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It is appropriate to use in web development, game development, and marketing campaigns that are always subject to change, and need constant collaboration from various team members. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Environments Software suites provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code like eclispe, and a Version Control Systems is a software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members like Git.  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

The challenges that software engineers are facing are changing requirement, project delays, tight deadlines, and technical debts. The challenges can be overcomed by effective and open communication, prioritization of tasks and regular meetings about project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: is testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering using a sentence as instruction for an AI model to get a specific action or ourput. Prompt engineering is important because it avoids vagueness and misunderstanding. AI will understand exactly what is needed from it,  because clear and concise statements were provided. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt is: " Tell me about cats". The generated answer from AI will be general and not focused. A specific and clear prompt: " Tell me about the history of domestic cats". The answer generated will be more clear, specific and focused.
